• Knowledge of Python programming [a crash course will be provided during lectures] 

• Familiarity with basic probability principles [useful, but not required; an overview will be 
provided during lectures but non-trivial math learning/understanding will be expected] 

• Familiarity with basic linear algebra [useful, but not required; an overview will be provided 
during lectures but non-trivial math learning/understanding will be expected]
